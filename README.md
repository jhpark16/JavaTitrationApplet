Acid base titration Java applet for a web page

## Panels
The applet is composed of 8 sequential panels of dialogs.
1. Introducition
A short description about the applet. This panel takes your name for the certificate.

2. Acid base selection for solution #1
You need to choose either one acid out of three acids (hydrochloric, nitric, and acetic acid) or one base out of three bases (sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and ammonia). You also need to select the volume and concentration of the solution #1. The concentration can be random or pre-determined.


3. Acid base selection for solution #2
You choose either acid or base depending on the choice you make on the Acid base selection #1. You choose the volume of the solution of a known concentration. This concentration and volume is used to
calculate the concentration of unknown solution (Solution #1).
